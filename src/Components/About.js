Our mission is to make it easy for people to order food from their favorite restaurants. We believe that everyone should have access to delicious, affordable food, no matter where they live or work. </p>

We started our company in 2014 with a simple goal: to connect people with the food they love. We've grown rapidly since then, and now we operate in over 100 cities across India.</p>
